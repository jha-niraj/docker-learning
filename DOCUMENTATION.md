		## Code Changes Explanation:

- The code defines two objects: `entry` and `newEntry`.
- `entry` object initially has the keys `name`, `age`, `country`, `city`, and `address`.
- `newEntry` object only has the keys `name`, `age`, and `country`.
- The `city` and `address` keys have been removed from the `newEntry` object.

## Key Modification Explanation:
1. **Entry Object:**
   - **name:** Updated from "Niraj Kumar Jha" to "Niraj Jha".
   - **city:** Removed from the object.
   - **address:** Removed from the object.

2. **NewEntry Object:**
   - **No changes**: The `newEntry` object was introduced with only `name`, `age`, and `country` keys.

## Summary of Changes:
The code changes involve modifying the `entry` object by updating the name and removing the `city` and `address` properties. Additionally, a new object `newEntry` is created with a subset of properties from the `entry` object.

## Observations:
- The removal of the `city` and `address` keys from the `newEntry` object might indicate a simplification or refactoring of the data structure.
- This change could be useful if the `city` and `address` information is not needed for the specific use case or if it is redundant in the context of the application.

### Code Changes:
```js
const newEntry = {
    name: "Niraj Jha",
    age: 23,
    country: "Nepal",
    city: "Kathmandu",
}
```

### Explanation:
- The code creates a new object named `newEntry` with four key-value pairs.
- The `name` key is set to "Niraj Jha", the `age` key is set to 23, the `country` key is set to "Nepal", and the `city` key is set to "Kathmandu".
- This code snippet adds a new object with personal information to the `newEntry` variable.

### Observations:
- This change introduces a new object `newEntry` with personal information.
- There are no differences between the previous and updated code as this is a new addition.
- This change is likely to be related to adding a new entry into a list or collection for processing.

    country: "Nepal",
    city: "Kathmandu",
    email: "jhaniraj45@gmail.com",
}
```
